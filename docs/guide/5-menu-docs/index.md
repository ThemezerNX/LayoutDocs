# Menu Docs

In order to get started, it is essential to know where you can find specific parts of the menus. The following pages lists many known components, but there also some yet undocumented. Feel free to contribute to this repository to help complete this list.

in the next few pages you will see file trees for bflyt files that can be altered a quick breakdown of a bflyt tree may contain:


-	**panel [pan 1]** - `[pan 1] usually the Root panel but you may have more panels within the root panel`
-	**part [prt 1]** - `[prt 1] partname which is linked to a seperate bflyt within the szs`
-	**pic [pic 1]** - `[pic 1] image related could be a icon / button example or similar`
-	**bnd [bnd 1]** - `[bnd 1] Button related`
-	**txt [txt 1]** - `[txt 1] text area -actual text isn't changable just color/opacity size & location`
